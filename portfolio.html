    <h1> My partner Haytham and I created this game on Scratch. We call this game Maze Starter, because it is our first attempt at creating a game using Scratch.
    The player controls the ball with the arrow keys and must navigate through a hazardous map layout to reach the end and win!</h2>

    <h2> Using App Inventor, my partner Yew Mun and I created a game called Tilt Maze. The goal of this game is to control a ball through a series of 4 levels by using a mobile device.
    The player must tilt their device in order to navigate the ball around the deadly walls that set you back. We integrated a countdown timer in order to increase the difficulty of the levels as the player progresses.
    Although we spent roughly about a week to create the game, there are feautures that we would like to add on in the future!</h3>

    <h4> My partner Dan and I crated an interactive game using Python coding! Here is the image to our LucidChart that basically summarizes the plot and choices the player can make throughtout the game. </h4>

    <h5> In this project, my partner Derek and I altered a few images using the Canopy application.
    We altered the images in creative ways using simple lines of code. Here is one example of an altered image, where a fish is looking at a rainbow.
    Below is the code that was used to create the new image.</h5>
